Keith Elms - WebDev Assignment #2

Hi Fred,

To access the new pages for assignment 2. load index.html, click on the hamburger menu icon in the header and select Admin Login. This will take you top the index2.php file that is the start of the assignment #2 content. I've added the pages for assignment 2 to those from assignment 1.

Everything was functioning properly on my local machine. My website is not opening properly with 000webnhost.com. All images are not loading. the Hamburger menu is functional but the hamburger icon is not loading, nor is the crossed-paddles image or the canoe in the lake, etc. Once you select 'Admin Login' from the hamburger menu, the warning message, "session_start(): Cannot start session when headers already sent in /storage/ssd2/569/20616569/public_html/header.php" appears on every page and the session variables only work for the problems.php page but fails to transfer 'role' variable to the the send-email.php later.

Thanks,

Keith
